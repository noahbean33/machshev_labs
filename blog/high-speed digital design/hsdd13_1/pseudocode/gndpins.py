"""Crosstalk in a high-speed connector, as a function of ground-pin pattern.

Transcribed from GNDPINS.mcd (an experimental worksheet; see gndpins.doc).

PSEUDOCODE. This is a simulation, not a closed-form sheet: it solves a
linear system for the ground-return currents and then sums the resulting
crosstalk. Written against numpy but not run.

The trick that makes the worksheet readable: positions in the 2-D connector
face are represented as COMPLEX numbers rather than 2-element vectors, so
the real part is horizontal and the imaginary part is vertical.

Two names are reused in the original with different meanings. They are
disambiguated here:
    Mathcad B(x, p)  -> field_B()        magnetic field intensity
    Mathcad B matrix -> B_flux           flux from signal currents
    Mathcad D        -> PITCH            pin spacing
    Mathcad D matrix -> D_gnd            flux from ground currents

Everything is in METERS in this worksheet, not inches.
